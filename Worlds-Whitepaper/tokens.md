When determining the cap table, three things should be kept in mind.
    1) Game developers should be incentivised to integrate their games into Worlds
    2) Gamers should be incentivised to play on Worlds
    3) The developers of Worlds should be rewarded if the platform is successful.
    4) We may need to raise capital (fiat)
Outline
---------------------
1) Incentivisation of game developers
    A certain percentage of the total supply of WOR should be kept in a
    treasury - managed by the developers of Worlds. This is given to game
    developers through a faucet mechanism, as apposed to a lump sum. If the
    developers stop making progress, the faucet is turned off and the funds are
    no longer delivered.

2) Incentivation of Players
    Setup an air grab in several stages, the WOR tokens you can grab are a
    percentage of your owned mainnet token at a given time. The airgrab should
    happen after platform launch, once people know what it's capable of.

3) Incentiation of Worlds Developers
    The trick is fair distribution. What I propose it - everyone tracks
    their hours against a commit. The hour tracking is kept in a simple text
    format with the number of hours, and the sha of the commit next to it. When
    the time comes to divide up the WOR, it's done as a fraction of hours. Ideally
    there is more than one token distrobution cycle, to foster new developers
    coming to help.

4) Raising
    This is simple, we sell tokens to accredited investors, this cash would then be
    used to hire developers or pay ourselves to work full time.

Proposed Distribution
---------------------
1) Game Developers - 40%
2) Players - 30%
3) Worlds Developers - 20%
4) Investment - 10%
